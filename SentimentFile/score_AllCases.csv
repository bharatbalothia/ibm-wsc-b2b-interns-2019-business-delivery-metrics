?
I uploaded the file thru FTP. But it failed (PID 37105547) in test due to I guess the mismatched ISA/GS Sender/Receiver ID's. Could you please provide me a list of ISA/GS IDs for the partners below (production ID as below for your reference)?
?
Ingram Micro US: Prod ID 004919486US
Synnex US: Prod ID SYNNEXISG
Tech Data US: 0819405530A20
Ingram Micro CA: Prod ID 004919486CA
Synnex CA: ?

Thanks,

I now understand what the issue is and will get the file name changed.

TS001385583,"Westwood Shipping Lines, Inc.",Customer,"I have changed the name of the outbound file to XML_WSL_ANSI315_HANKOOKROK[DATENNNNNNNNN].  I have tested it in our system and it goes out to IBM fine, but it is not being processed in CTE - I am sure that they failed.   I sent 11 messages.  Please change the name in your CTE system and see if they will process.  If so, I will do the same in Production.

Thanks for the update. But client changed the path and configured the below two folders at their end.
 
\\ntb2bcontest01\sci\test\AmazonPOS\inbound
\\ntb2bcontest01\sci\test\AmazonPOS\stage\inbound.
 
Kindly update our folders accordingly and provide us the path in which we need to place the SLSRPT Transaction files.
Please note that this folder is only for AMAZON SLSRPT Folders.

Please see attached/uploaded files for this request - Monash University have issued comments about our invoice file. In addition to additions and removals, we are required to map through specific Bill To data, which means the ORDER file map will also be impacted. The catalyst and requirement is form the INVOICE file so ill only place it here, please adjust the ORDER file map to pull through the required data.
