?
I uploaded the file thru FTP. But it failed (PID 37105547) in test due to I guess the mismatched ISA/GS Sender/Receiver ID's. Could you please provide me a list of ISA/GS IDs for the partners below (production ID as below for your reference)?

I have tested it in our system and it goes out to IBM fine, but it is not being processed in CTE - I am sure that they failed.   I sent 11 messages.  Please change the name in your CTE system and see if they will process.  If so, I will do the same in Production.

TS002062680,"New Era Cap Co., Inc.",Customer,"Hello Lori,
From my perspective I struggle to understand that a new PER is requested to just change an email title.
In all cases, it is not worth going to that direction so we will push the existing change in production when IBM is able to do so.
