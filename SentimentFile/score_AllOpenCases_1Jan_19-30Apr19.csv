When testing with one of our trade partners they are sending (^) delimiters in their inbound documents however when I look it up in CTE they have been transformed to (*) delimiters causing some errors to occur. Is this a setup problem on our side or are these documents coming in from OpenText this way?

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation. I'll keep PER Form as up to date as possible.

Regarding your question about the number of AS2 connection. I think Frode Laursen prefers to have two separate AS2 Channels or ID. I dont know the process behind AS2 Channel creation on IBM but in SAP PO world we are able to create one channel and use two different IDs. I think the fastest way to understand Frode Lauresen and to avoid any delay ist to conatct Bjarne Sørensen (bjhoj@frode-laursen.com).

If necessary, we can set up a quick meeting with them to get the clarification. 

I have a status meeting at 09:00 CET. Could you please tell me when the PRICAT channel will be ready? Thanks!

I appreciate the time you have spent on this, it's been a big help.

We do need to set Sky High as a new TP Lookup value in our ERP so we would be sending 2 different <TradingPartner> tags in the ORDERS XML but would need both to go to 102108446WP:01.  

If it is ok to append the NAD+SE value sent back to the EDI code to get 2 different codelist values then this will be off great help to us.  This would actually only be for ORDRSP as we have been told that INVOIC messages will be sent manually.

My only question is when you say you would append the NAD+SE value to the EDI code before performing the codelist check to get the TP Lookup Code, does this mean you have to the same for all TP's using the same map or would it be for that EDI code only?  If it's all TP's then wouldn't it be high risk as you would need to change the codelist entries for a lot of TP's?

Thanks for the info. I suspected the qualifier would be a part of the code as well.  I was trying to find an easy way you could differentiate between 2 PF Lookups pointing to the same EDI/GLN code and was hoping i could use the qualifier.  The only other option is using the NAD+SE segment but this obviously mean reading forward in the message until you find it which is not a brilliant solution.  Our third option is that you always use the same TP Lookup code on inbound messages but I need to make sure that it would work in our ERP.

TS002020744,Premier Farnell Ltd.,Customer,"One other question please.

Is it possible to use the same EDI/GLN code with a different qualifier code without affecting the routing of the message via a VAN?

For example CYPRESS use 102108446WP : 01 for their Production EDI and 102108446WT : 01 for Test.
If we sent something to 102108446WP : 02 as an example is that classed as a completely different EDI code?  Would it need changes within the mailboxes to work or do they only use the 102108446WP part of the code, with the qualifier used internally by the customer?

As I said before, all corresponding Mappings will be implemented by Lindt SAP PO team. That means for IBM it will be a pass through interfaces.

Regarding filename for interfaces from Lindt to FrodeLaursen, we will send use following convention:

LSSE_FL_5790000000548_PRICAT_<TEST|PROD>-<TimeStamp>.EDI

Hi,
Please review PID: 58284366 in CTE. 
1.      The B1001 should be the search reference number in Inflight. Not the B1002.
2.      Please clarify why the N1SF nor the N1ST is not being mapped? I see logic in place in the map- Input tab-line 850. The N1 segments should populate in the EDI file.

Our WHS partner Murpf tried to send a message in production to us but it failed (400 bad request).
Lindt CH sent MATMAS IDoc in production to Murpf but it was rejected (PID = 1646974649).

Regarding the ""400 bad request"" failure get in touch with the EDI service partner Inconso.

In the test environment (CTE) we receive messages from WHS partner MURPF bei they are dismissed.
Log file ""Flat_File.dat"" contains the following contents (see below).

All messages exchanged between LindtCH and MURPF are Pass-Thru which means IBM Sterling MUST NOT CARE about any contents in these files.

NEXT STEP:
Remove the blockage of incoming messages from MURPF in CTE IMMEDIATELY!

It has been earlier requested to removed. It should fetch from

Chris,

JackRabbit want the order charge (drop ship fee) mapped to ZZZZ qualifier on the EDI 810 invoice instead of adding it to G821

The fee would be under the SCAC segment. Example:

SAC*C*ZZZZ***300~  $3.00 drop ship fee
SAC*C*H850***0~  tax
SAC*C*G821***1299~  shipping charge

I tried to test 1 file in CTE (Process ID : 24536860) but it got failed due to missing envelope. I think it is because that codelist needs to be updated.

The tracking number is required so if there is no tracking number MAN*CP, then they want us put the value in MAN*GM in MAN*CP.

 ?Looking at the shipment, we were expecting something just a smidge different, which is what caused the tracking failure. MAN*GM should be MAN*CP, which should then establish the tracking number.?

TS002108650,August Brötje GmbH,Customer,"Hello Abida,
I read your message again, and I noticed something else. You have written: ... if you send the documents with Receiver ID : 2062188, it will be routed to Pum to new X400 address.

Therefore no translation of the customer number to the UA-ID is needed anymore. This is good and I will transfer the new receiver ID 2062188 in the source file for ORDRSP and INVOIC from Thursday.
?If more (or all) houses of the PuM group are moved to the new address, this can be done without your help.

Best Regards
Wolfgang

The file that was sent a few minutes ago is STILL a copy of the DARBY map! 

Look at Input tab, Cell H3.  It reads : 

//Base Map : HF_DARBY_I_850_4010

Can you simply take the MRS_PM_PCOO_I_850_4010_03292019 file and make it THE MAP? This is what the map should look like.

Please call or have someone call me in the US at 773-230-4707.

I am very frustrated. 

I did not request a copy of the Darby map! I do not know how a Darby map got involved in this. My original request contained a copy of a Hu-Friedy/Patterson map.

Patterson's map and Darby's map have many differences. I cannot spend time looking for all the differences between the Darby copy your team created and my requested Patterson map. The mapping team did not follow my instructions from 3/29.

Can you give me a call to discuss?

thanks for your Information. Yes please create  a setup for EDI ID 2062188 with new X400 address in production system . Then PuM can start sending on Thursday, 11th April for their 1. location  ?""Pfeiffer&May, Freiburg"". 
We will send ORDRSP and INVOIC to ?""Pfeiffer&May, Freiburg"" with customer no. 1090370 or 1090370I. This has to be routed to 2062188 with new X400 Address from Thursday.
Alternatively, I can also transfer the new ID 2062188 for outgoing messages in the XML file in the envelope instead of the customer number 1090370 or 1090370I, so that this can be transferred directly into the UNB segment.
If this is running good, we will change all Locations from PuM to EDI ID 2062188 with new X400 address.  This only concerns the relationship of Broetje to PuM and I will give you a list with all customer ID which have to be transfered to the new address.

PuM will first change one location (PuM Freiburg) to the new x400 address on Thursday morning. 
That means, that they send ORDERS with the new UA-ID 2062188 (the old UA-ID is 2015276?) via the new X400 address.

Our outgoing Messages (ORDRSP and INVOIC) have still the same Customer no. ""1090370"". These Messages have to be transfered to UA-ID/ Receiver-ID 2062188 in UNB Segment and send to the new X400 address.

When this is running fine the next days, PuM want to Change all Locations to the new X400 Address.
Do you need a list of all our PuM customer no.?

They are a company new to EDI as a process and they are dealing with a different customer first before switching to us.  They are also adamant that they want to go live with the first partner before testign with any others, so we will not be testing until they are fully finished with the other party.

Thanks for making the changes.

I can see the changes are correct in the shared output file.
But when i am trying to test file in QA then
 ""SNDPRN"" i.e. sold #?? is still not mapped
  - data should be - 100007823
  E2EDKA3 segment PARTN and LIFNR for Sold #?? has not been mapped
       - data should be - 100007823
For reference Process ID - 24274879 (CTE)

I compare both the edi files and one difference i found in C&D ISA and GS ID's 
Test files shared have ID - ZZ*RECEIVER
wheres correct IDs are 12*6092797788 and GS - 6094977426.
I am not sure whether this is the reason of missing values.

I am also attaching the input file and output file tested in CTE(IP:EDI_Custom_QTDK_PO_850_EDI and OP: IDoc_Custom_QTDK_PO_850_EDI)

Kindly check and share your inputs.

The original TP Lookup code I gave you was for our TEST ERP system. I need that changed now for our PROD ERP system.

Request #?1
Please change the official TP Lookup code to: 2207104000

Request #?2
For the near future, my TEST and PROD systems will have different TP numbers.

Add Logic so that 2207104000 is the default, but if ISA15=?T? THEN Consider the TP as: 2206508000

In Output tab, in Cell H25, Change Ext. Rule to:
  #?SNDPRN = ?2207104000?;
  IF ISA15=?T? THEN #?SNDPRN = ?2206508000?;

I think it might be easier to make this a case where the IBM implementer can communicate directly with Geodis. That seems to me to be the best way to get things set up as quickly as possible and with minimal chance of confusion. 
It would also mean that some progress can be made whilst I am out of the office next week.

CORAMINE is a company from Saint-Gobain but they don't use SAP.

So i can't send you SAP code.

We already have the same flow for customer Point P.

You can check example in Inflight production and used the same logic.

Changes are required in the mapping of ACK22 element. Please see below mapping logic.
Updated MRS and input file is attached for reference.

ACK22 Mapping Logic:

If ACK03 = EA then 

ACK22 = map 12 digit UPC code from E2EDP19002/IDTNR where E2EDP19002/QUALF:6 = UP

Else 

ACK22 = Map 13 digit UPC code from E2EDP19002/IDTNR where E2EDP19002/QUALF:6 = HE



IF ACK03 = (CS or CA) then 

ACK22 = map 14 digit GTIN code from E2EDP19002/IDTNR where E2EDP19002/QUALF:6 = UK

Could you please check the below information from TP

Yes, the same parameters are maintained on our System.

But why do you have ?Kostal North America Inc_Test_Details:?
We are testing ASNs sent from Kostal Germany not Kostal NA. In the past the connection was SSID O0013000330IBM735 / SFID O0013000330IBM735-SBTESLA.
The error message is ?'User code not known'?, so I guess the SFID isn?t maintained on the IBM system

The 850 PID in CTE  24880867 is the input file associated with the 810 in CTE PID: 24898916. The 810 should have  Firstcheck in the ISA and GS as is the same way it is in Production. 

The McKesson 810 map is used for McKesson IMI and McKesson Firstcheck as well as Strategic Sourcing Services. 

When sending this original Map Change Request I did not realize I would need to mention McKesson FirstCheck and how the ISA/GS is not the same as McKesson IMI as this is the map that has been used in Production for several years. I assumed that the map shows the difference. Is that not correct? 

Please let me know if this clarifies things or whether or not I need to go into further detail.

My apologies if I worded this request incorrectly.

The McKesson BU1 810 map is used for both IMI and First Check, Trading Partner 605110 and Strategic Sourcing Services TP 622225.

The updated information is populating correctly however, when testing in CTE I noticed that the First Check 810 is coming up as an IMI 810.

The First Check ISA/GS is different than IMI, see PID in Production 930722924.

ISA*05 and ISA*06 should be: ZZ*FIRSTCHECK
GS*02 should be: FIRSTCHECK

See PID in CTE for how the 810 appears: 24890437

Wal-Mart uses a self-service tool on their Retail Link site (similar to the Amazon self-service testing we completed) to set up and test the EDI documents.  The first step is to set up the AS2 connection by installing the AS2 certificates.   Can you provide me with a copy of our AS2 certificate so I can upload it to their site.  Once I do that, I should be able to download the Wal-mart certificate, which I'll forward to you.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

On #? 1.  Yes..  please update the required date as well with the same value used in the NEEDDELV.
** good catch.. i had not caught this.. thank you.
On #? 2.  Correct.  With this logic we are building in a minimum 10 day lead time on the orders.
When it is ""JVM"" id.. then the date used will always be >= current date + 10.
On #? 3.  For NON JVM ids we want the same logic except to use 15 in place of 10.  For these transactions we are building in a minimum 15 day lead time.  So the date used will always >= curr date + 15.
On #?4... actually after further review treat the ""GAM"" id as NON JVM.. so no special code needed... it would have a 15 day lead time.
   If the DTM is not present the simply use current date

Does the Trading Partner Id ?field (position 21) in the HDR field have to be GPITESTIVAN?  We use the inbound 850 data and label the Trading partner as CARQUEST (not CLCARQUEST) and would use that as the Trading Partner Id field value.  As soon as we generate a shipment, I will add the 810 flat file to this ticket.

The mapping did not work.  Please see the attached MRS.  The MESCOD is at the bottom marked in yellow.  In the example raw data below. The MESCOD should be populated only when checking N101 = ""WH"". Please do not check if N101 = ""DE"" or other qualifiers. ""WH"" should determine if MESCOD will be ""Z02"" or ""C1"". I hope this makes sense.

the equation would like something like this:

If N101 = ""WH"" (If N104 = ""318"" map ""Z02"" else map ""C1"")

The Sender ID combination on this PER / Case is one of the Sender IDs that will be a pass-through.  It is for Adient - Lexington.

01 / 007018955

I am not sure if they have a ""test"" ID to use yet.

For this pass-through setup in CTE, please use:

SENDER ID:  01 / 007018955
RECEIVER ID: 01 / 247791247T

Let me know when this is set up and I will drop a file as a test using the current Connect:Direct setup.

Thank you,

Confirmed.  There will be multiple Sender IDs with a single Receiver ID ?(?01 / 247791247).  I used LPBPTTEST for the receiver ID for this testing.  For our test scenarios, as we submit PERs, ANY inbound Sender ID paired with this Receiver ID will be a pass-through.

To simplify this a bit, please change 01 / LPBPTTEST to 01 / 247791247 for the processing rules.  We will submit our PERs with this Receiver ID.

For the Outbound documents (X12 830/862 4010), the Sender ID will be 01 / 247791247. There will be multiple Receiver IDs.

- No.  We will not be sending the same Sender ID and Receiver ID for all inbound transactions.
- As of now, it will be the same Receiver ID for all inbound transactions (?01 / 247791247).

In addition to the Inbound documents, we will have at least 2 outbound pass-through transactions for ANSI X12 830 4010 and ANSI X12 862 4010.  What do I need to do to get these set up to ""pass-through"" as outbound documents?

The test worked.  The output file was the same as the input file.  The pass-through map made no changes.?

- On the IBM Inflight display, the document type shows as ""DATA"".  Can that be updated to show the actual document type that is being passed through (830)?  That would be the same request for all pass-through maps (830, 862, 856, DELFOR, DELJIT, DESADV, etc).
- Do you have default pass-through maps for all of the setups shown in the attached document/table?
- When we submit PERs to have these pass-through maps setup for the sender/receiver IDs, do we need the map names or do we just reference them as the default pass-through map for the specific standard, doc, and version?

I don't believe we need to set this PER up using the same data flow as outlined in the PER (FTP).  Since this is a translation and the translated documents will becoming to L&P, they will still need to flow through connect:direct (C:D) to our \Inbound folder.

I dropped the test file into CTE (with ""T"" in ISA15) and did not get the results we expected.  I suspect this Sender/Receiver ID combination already has an envelope/configuration setup for one of our existing 830 maps.

The PID that resulted is:?  15404209.  It shows up as an inbound and outbound 830 transaction.

Additionally, the file I got into our Inbound folder was the translated, pipe-delimited flat file.  I did not receive the pass-through X12 document.

Should we set this up with a different set of Sender / Receiver IDs (""bogus"") for this testing?

Let me know so we can proceed.  Thank you.

TS001932165,Schlüter Systems KG,Customer,"Hello Rajeev,

?I remember that in the first discussion was metioned that such table exisits.

I do not understand the sense behind such a table:

If an invoice is accepted by the SDI and transfered to the receipient's privat area and also sent to TRUSTWEAVER, codice destinatario, then the invoice is for my understanding automatically valid and the IdFiscaleIVA/Codice Fiscale was checked by SDI.

Why does a table exists which doublecheck this and who maintain normally this list?

Thank you for a feedback.

Thanks for checking this further with Rick.

Firstly, the PID mentioned below was in fact a message posted by myself using the URL mentioned in the description of this case. Thus, I can confirm that was not posted by the customer.
Secondly, I am aware of the issue with missing UserLogonID in our PROCBUYPRF table; it's a trivial issue and can be fixed easily.

Just to re-iterate: my real issue here is with the customer not being able to post the PO XML into the IBM URL below.

We have an additional set of changes to make and then this should be good to go:
1) The CW_CODE references a name in the ZZ segment. ""Rob Dawson"" and ""Amelia Roberts"". This should be a code provided by the business. This is column BJ in the attached test file ( 811_3358_Test 12 December 2018 - 5 April 2019 Resend.csv ). Our contact at Bloomberg also had this to say: ""I took another look and it seems that instead of replacing the |ZZ|DR| the tax code was inserted which push the other fields over. "" I'll attach the sample of how the raw EDI should look (811_3358_Test 12 December 2018 - 5 April 2019 Resend RAW EDI Revised.txt)
 
2) The amount in the TDS segment should be the total inclusive of tax.

Please let me know if there are any questions or if you need any additional info.

Yes, the example below is in the correct format. The logic you described should be applied to any filed received by IBM which is blank. 

We noticed another error within the <ETAFinalDestinationDate> segment. The date format is incorrect which causes PO failures. Please review the latest map provided with correct format.

Thanks for explaining, although I do not fully understand your process. So let me try to bridge the gap.

- There is no longer any 2206892000.
- I will still send 810's from QA6CLNT010 and from PRDCLNT010.
- They will both be for 2206741000.
- The only difference I would expect is that:- 810's from QA6CLNT010 should have ISA15=""T""
- 810's from PRDCLNT010 should have ISA15=""P""

Do you need to make any changes for this to be true?

TS001300301,Heska Corporation,Customer,"Hello
As a follow-up to our concerns with Pathway Test data getting into production and causing an order to be placed accidentally, I suggested that Pathway redirect their test files to an alternate folder on their system which puts the test files in a location other than what was mapped when  IBM was picking up and processing the test documents for Heska. 
Pathway just wrote:
I have created the /Test Directory on the test Server/ID. I have adjusted the config to populate the test system there. Can you have IBM confirm that these will not be swept into PRoduction?

So basically, if the file is not in the root directory, is it true that IBM processes will not detect it and pick it up? Is this correct??

""It was an issue with the sender/receiver id in the file. The correct sender and receiver ids are Casino_CEVA and Casino_GTNEXUS whereas in the file, it came as ?CASINO_GTNEXUS? that?s the reason the file didn?t process.""

Source File Name: uTrade_PO_Report_02052019_B

We removed row which had errors due to code list and re-drop source file ""uTrade_PO_Report_02052019_B"". However, new errors are appearing in the report that are not associated to the code list.

Even on the original file ""uTrade_PO_Report_02052019"" with the code list errors, we did not see PO file split the manner we expect. The split should be based on the PONo field in report. In this case we expect IBM to split files correctly and POs with code list look ups should successfully process and ones with issues should fail.

See response below.

- The example file has a single PO in it. Can you please provide a file with multiple POs so that we can appropriately test the split - JT: Yes, we will work on getting you another example file. 
- Will there only be 1 line in the TIM file per PO or will some POs span multiple lines?

I am attaching a new test map from Pathways (TEST_HESKA_20190410_150103_3) that contains this reformatting. Will this affect our map? Do we need to permit the N9 to be in either position or will we be hard coding to the pre-N1 option?

  Allied's SAP system places invoices into their corresponding folders.  Our development system creates invoices and places them in the associated development invoice folder which we then route through to CTE.  The production environment places the files in a live folder which again are rooted into IBM's live environment.
We do not differentiate the files based on file content i'm afraid.

Hello Andy,

 Good Morning,
  Regarding the test invoice that was sent earlier in the week.  The TP have contacted me to mention it has not been received.  Could you please change the destination address as per the customers email below and reprocess the file?
Many Thanks,

I see that it has been confirmed again in the portal that a test invoice was sent ? but I am not able to locate it.
Was this sent to the Morrisons TEST GLN 14:5013546229793 ?

TS002001837,Eddie Stobart Ltd,Customer,"Good Evening,

Please see reference number 3550092147?. On the message I planned to test if the first order line had a missing SHDELN data (from position 53 TO 62) so I would expected to get this data from the next available record line which it didn?t.

This then ended up with the TDT field not being populated on the first UNH/UNT build on the attached message.

Can you look into this please?

Can you please look at Case Number TS002014646 and Case Number TS002014492. 

I wanted another change made or adjustment made to Update the REF and PER logic to no longer concatenate extra info. (REF and PER concatenate logic removed )

I have CSR employees and want to make the messages a simple as possible with less technical information. This was done for these Case numbers that I have mentioned above and would like this done to this case as well please.

These messages are blocked on you EDI platform. Why? The request was that every inbound message starting with ""LSNL"" is forwarded to us with a specific rule for the destination filename.

Here is the (hopefully) final revision for the source -> destination file naming convention:
Our WHS partner will send file names like
LSNL-MBGMCR-101.XML   (XML-IDoc) or
LSNL-RECADV-456.EDI      (EDIFACT)

Here are the three rules for creating the destination filename:
- Replace prefix LSNL by LSNL_8720098000011
- Replace all minus signs (-) by underline (_)
- Add between filename and suffix (.XML or .EDI) and underline (_) and a unique ID (e.g. processID)

Example: LSNL-MBGMCR-101.XML will become
- LSNL_8720098000011-MBGMCR-101.XML
- LSNL_8720098000011_MBGMCR_101.XML
- LSNL_8720098000011_MBGMCR_101_<unique ID, e.g. PID>.XML

Apparently the messages sent by WHS partner OLA which begin with LSNL are forwarded by your EDI platform. However, generation of the destination filename is incorrect. Currently we get:
LSNL-MBGMCR-101.XML (Source) -> LSNL_8720098000011_MBGMCR_UNIQUEID.XML (Dest)

However, we have requested only to replace the prefix LSNL by LSNL_8720098000011:
LSNL-MBGMCR-101.XML (Source) -> LSNL_8720098000011-MBGMCR-101.XML (Dest)

Adjust the source-to-destination file naming rule accordingly.

I've never used Data Recipient for trading partner specific data so that column has always been blank.  If I add a row for Walmart and change Start Availability to a future date, is there a way to track this?  Meaning, the reason there's one date for Walmart and another date for all other TPs?   The reason for the changing the date is to fix/update the status on WM's Publication Detail report, it's not a real Start Availability Date.  Does that matter?

We have shortened the length of the message type resulting in filenames like:

I think you described precisely what I meant: I don't want to address the individual replica, instead I want to address the service, i.e. all replicas. And I wanted to twiggle the naming of the services in Swarm, don't know of the possibilities, if not possible we would configure the _service_ names in Vault. I hope to work on this a bit this week, before my holidays next week; you can leave the case assigned to me.

Bear with me if I'm not understanding completely, infrastructure is not my specialty, I had to think about this here for a while ;)</p><p></p><p>Could we please not call our approach a ""customized"" one? When we started out back in June 2018, IBM could or would not tell us what the ""preferred"" runtime setup was (we had seen and reviewed both reference solutions, Kubernetes &amp; DC/OS, so we asked). Without ICP, instead of bringing in all tools at once, like Kubernetes, Vault, ELK, ...,  we chose to start small, use the standard Docker Swarm instead of a separate orchestration tool, and bring in Vault and ELK as we'd go along. Docker Swarm also activates an Ingress routing mesh by default (so I guess we could also configure the hosts and rules like the ones you cited to have nice external URLs).</p><p></p><p>Services are available internally with names like &lt;Swarm name&gt;_&lt;Service name&gt;. I guess these should be the names referenced internally, instead of a host name, so the calls would be load balanced over container instances, do you agree? So first, we could reconfigure the Docker Swarm naming scheme, so that the service names would be exactly what the ""client side"" expects when nothing is configured in Vault; I'm unsure about the internal domain name there, but we may figure that out. Secondly, if that succeeds, the txHost/xcHost/... in Vault could be removed. And thirdly, we would have the naming scheme for routing exactly as with the reference / new standard, Kubernetes. What do you think? Thanks for your input.</p><p></p><p>Regards, Theodoor</p>",-0.9367006299410419,,

Noted on this point. We will push customer to follow this and update you if anything. There are 1 concerns we found again while testing ( seems the logic is by passed)
- When a CSV is sent with multiple line with different PO numbers.
Expected result: IBM should validate the Header matching rule - if any value is different in header - Order should fail including order number.
Actual Result: IBM processed the PO successfully and could not recogonize the 2 different order number and multiple lines. It combined each lines under 1 PO number. Please see PID: 5d8f7abc-6266-11e9-8c3d-0a2320210000

Thank you for below analysis.  Yes we will integrate more customer to this map.
Since at the moment - JSIKCSV is the only customer using this map( which is not real customer but a dummy one) , the inflight shows all PO with this sender, which i think make sense and you are correct.

What we want is - when we add more customer in future to this map (I believe those will be as usual PER we raise to IBM) - then inflight should show sender id of those customers , instead of JSIKCSV always. If you see that is OK, then i guess no more change required and we will test on existing code only.

Thank you,

Regards,
Gajendra

TS001328116,Sigma-Aldrich Corporation,Customer,"Hi Rick,

Thank you for the clarification. I tested again and noticed
- If we don't send the from ID - map fails - passed- But the Inflight keep displaying sender ID as JSIKCSV even though no From ID exists in file

- If we send any other value at From ID - Map pass - passed- But the inflight still display ""JSIKCSV"" as sender.

Is this behavior normal.? Isn't the Inflight should show the sender same as From ID.
Please see PID:

From the TP:
the primary thing is to make sure that you guys are using your own map. If you ended up going to a generic one that other distributors are using then of course we will have a problem because they get CS and no decimals. I will try to dig a tad bit deeper, but we are past the map change threshold that opentext laid down which was COB 1-24 (Yesterday).

TS001328116,Sigma-Aldrich Corporation,Customer,"Hi Rick and IBM,

There is a small conflict we would like to clarify with you. May i ask you to confirm what are the CSV segment names that were initially agreed and map is designed to accomodate.
As per my knowledge -

According to MRS - the CSV has 13 segments as following order:
FromIdentity*, OrderDate*, SharedSecret, SenderIdentity, CustomerOrderNumber*, ShipToCode, ShipToName, ContactEmail, BillToCode, Comment, Quantity*, SupplierPartID*, BuyerPartNumber*

Those with * are mandatory. I remember Nisha has given the requirement but may i confirm with you if we are aligned on this.?

If that is the case  - we would like to add 4 more optional segments ""Bill-to Name"" , Bill-to Country"", ""Unit PRice, ""Item Description"".

Is it possible to modify the map and add them now.? Please let me know first.

Thank you

we need to have the incoming EDI ORDER file from our customer processed and converted to an SAP IDOC (this step has nothing to do with the map this case is about buit with the respective incoming orders map) so that we can afterwards process the sales order in SAP, create the delivery and the DESADV IDOC.

I don't actually have the 856 specs from Dillards, I will try to get them.

Having said that, the 856 is already active for Dillards for SmartWool - that map is SMART_DILLARD_O_856_4030VICS

It doesn't working PID 1dad50e9-df30-41d9-9d60-1f28336df6f6 in error. 

When i say : 
""Segment 0090_ALC :

It means do not map 0090_ALC but map other ALC like 0090_ALC:3 or/and 0090_ALC:2.

Could you please correct it ?

thank you for applying the fix (the NVE number is now correct).
BUT:
the structure of the DESADV file still does not fit (there are no changes when compared to the previous version).
Please see the sample file from Hornbach and page 13 of their guideline:

The LIN-segments (and further line item details, like PIA, IMD, QTY, RFF) need to be grouped below the PAC segment.

That means, you need to sort and group the line items by GIN number (PAC segment) - there must be only one unique GIN segment!

Please apply these changes and let me know when they are available in CTE.

Unfortunately, the NVE number (GIN segment) is missing our constant identifier which is similar to the GLN code, meaning ist must start with 34009071.

The L0.08 value doesn't look to be populating correctly. The mapping is map B2BMessage\Data\ManageInvoiceRequest\ARInvoice\InvoiceLines\Line\QuantityOrdered, but the EDI 210 InvoiceL0.08 is null.

Also, I need:
L0.09 to be a constant value of PCS
Expected Output: L0*1***150*N***15*PCS

Remove mapping for L1.05, L1.06, L1.07, and L1.08 ONLY WHERE OrgMemoLineName = BAS
Expected Output: L1*1*19.94*CW*4800 where OrgMemoLineName = BAS
Expected Output: L1*2*12.48*FR*1248****405 where OrgMemLineName <> BAS

I ran the PO file through our system and everything went through perfectly.  I will upload the invoice .csv file from our system for you to test that end of the map on your end.  If everything works OK, I think we should be ready to do some testing with the customer to make sure the transactions are transmitting properly.

Let me know if you encounter any problems with the invoice .csv file

I think we just identified the root cause behind why the Sandvik files are not loading into OFS correctly.
It looks like you have configured the JMS Doc type as 'Booking_XML' where as it should have been IFTMIN_FF' as mentioned in the PER. The Booking_XML is only the Inflight Doc Type and should not be used as a JMS setting.
Please fix this ASAP and let me know when its done so we can test it again.

There is a change in the output layout. Attaching the format. Here the change is to group the <CommodityInfo> 
<ExportLicenseInfo>

The field mapping remains the same.
Ex: for a single file if L13,X1,VEH are repeated multiple times, the output should contain the looping logic. Attaching the mapping specs, structure change file, input file and expected output file.

I will review it again and send you an updated version so you can fix these issues in one shot.

But for the meantime, please remove mandatory clause of those two tags so we can see the translation flow through correctly. Let me know when it's ready in CTE and I will ask the customer to send another test file.

AttachmentList/ eMailAddress/ IssuingRef/ ConsigneeRefs/ ShipperRefs/ TaxAreaSections/TaxAreaSummarySections è These are optional tags in v6 XSD or v5 XSD, therefore it will be available only the data are exist in OFS & it depends on setup of customer, issuer, consignee, shipper or country.
Please make sure to add all of the tags so we don't encounter this issue going forward.
Let me know after it is ready in CTE
REFER to ticket#?TS001772885 for what Carol did on a similar issue last week.

I got your voicemail. To answer your question, yes, the ISA Control number doesnt exist in this case as we are receiving an XML from the customer. In such cases, I would recommend that you come up with a 9 digit number (ex: 0000000001) and start incrementing it for for each file received from the customer. Hope that answers your question.

Please refer to PID 54841266 as it failed translation due to the following reason.
'IssuingRef' tag did not have any value in it previously but is now populated and I believe is missing in your Schema. We had had similar issues with the schema in the last couple of weeks and Carol has fixed it by adding the following tagss in the v6 XSD:
AttachmentList/ eMailAddress/ IssuingRef/ ConsigneeRefs/ ShipperRefs/ TaxAreaSections/TaxAreaSummarySections è These are optional tags in v6 XSD or v5 XSD, therefore it will be available only the data are exist in OFS & it depends on setup of customer, issuer, consignee, shipper or country.
Please make sure to add all of the tags so we don't encounter this issue going forward.

We are only setting up Terra and Kodiak for MWW.  This should flow just like Timberland does from IBM to MWW as far as I know.   I will double check but that is my understanding.  

And I also found out that there should never be materials for multiple brands on the same 850 so we should receive separate orders for Kodiak and Terra from MWW.

I am not seeing how we can do the split based on PO1*BP because that is a material number and not a vendor ID.  It appears that our middleware is making this split based on the material number when the order is currently sent from SPS Commerce.  Can we just set up the Kodiak map for now with EDI ID ZZ/KODIAKFWTST  as the receiver for the 850?  I'm going to have to run a test through our system and see what happens.  I can see that the Application area and sender are set up differently in SOA for Kodiak and everyone keeps telling me I don't need to worry about that so I'll just try a test order and see what happens.

It seems that there is a problem with the recent map change. The latest ASN was rejected by customer because the LIN~RC is wrong. See PID 1666684254. In that example the LIN~RC should looks like this:
LIN**RC*00000EXP
SN1**22*EA*22
The reason is because we have 22 containers(00000EXP) in total.
Please fix the map and let me know when it is ready to be re-tested.

it seems that the test file is wrong, so discard what happend with TR0049.
I tried with a similar example which is right, so please see PID 34230839 from CTE.
For this example the output should look like this:

the SN102 is still failing. See PID 34225089 from CTE.

Taking as reference that example you will see that:
For LIN**RC*TR0051, its corresponding SN1 segment, should look like this --> SN1**3*EA*3. This is because there are three E2EDL37 with the same VHILM value which is TR0051 for the same material.
Same case for LIN**RC*TR0056 where its SN1 segment should look like this --> SN1**2*EA*2, because there are 2 E2EDL37 segments with the same VHILM value which is TR0056.

TS002159594,IBM Deutschland,Customer,"I found the root cause why the upload did not work correctly.
However this still needs to be corrected and is part of our discussion with OM (Define Job and API Monitoring Needs).

RootCause:
In the formula for Coordinates and SourceLink there was an error which cause the formula to evaluate to an error (#?VALUE / #?WERT).
It was relying on the data which has been sent by the client. Some coordinate values did have Integer values (not sure why) and only some of them did have decimal values. The ones with the Integer values did cause this #?VALUE error to occur.

I would suggest to degrade the severity (as the Sev2 is not relevant anymore) and to continue the discussion with OM regarding visibility and data  job monitoring.

But this issue could be an excellent sample  for a testing scenario which should be included into the upload status reporting.

This has now become an issue for IKEA FastStart as well.
It seems that for custom KPIs the cache NEVER gets updated once a score is defined.
The score is updated nearly instantly (due to the limited set of data) but the list view (either all records or filtered by dimension) is never updated.

I have two cKPIs (evaluating exactly the same) one I have updated (IKEA - DCG Stock Out Articles based on Forecast) another one I have created (NEW: IKEA - DCG Stock Out Articles based on Forecast).

The data upload is from yesterday. Since now for 6 hours the data has not changed (although the scoring did) for the KPI I updated.

IN addition to the Manufacture code, request you to please truncate TRAY for the distributor as well.
ie.

- truncate the TRAY in E22EDP19001/IDTNR with QUALF=002
If #?GlobalPartnerClassificat:31 = ""Distributor"" then
    Map #?ProprietaryProductIdenti:2 (remove trailing ""TR""- already existing & ""TRAY"") to E2EDP19001/IDTNR with QUALF=001

- truncate the TRAY in E22EDP19001/IDTNR with QUALF=001

Where <ProductServiceQualifier>=KERRYMFGWHS, take the value in <ProductServiceID> and look up against table to determine N104 value. Populate N104 where N101=M9.

Where N101=SF look at the N402 for a zip code value. Take that value and look up against table to populate N104 where N101=SF.

It is not feasible for us to change our numbering scheme to have those 5 digit item numbers in the GTINs.  We have quite a few items already posted, and our method is to have the UPC of the item in the GTIN.  

Just to reiterate, I have to

TS002014434,CEVA LOGISTICS,Customer,"Hi Bijoy,
I need a couple of small changes to be added to the changes that are being done now. They are highlighted on v4.1 of the uploaded paper mapping.
-  Row 99&100 - add MBL reference
-  Row 110 - added logic to pickup place reference for Ocean shipments
- Row 128 - RateType reference should only be sent for air shipments. Added logic to only send for Air shipments...If first letter of <ServiceCode> = 'P'...

These changes along with the changes sent to you on Friday, need to be completed ASAP.  This project has been escalated and is a HIGH priority.

Donna

I assume this new change has been tested and confirmed working by recreating the issue?  It makes me slightly nervous if this isn't going to be packaged into an APAR as every time we deploy APARs at teh moment our di-buildindex.sh changes get reverted and cause us to experience the issue again.   I would assume with this in mind the fix allows the existing buildindex script to work as is?

All Booking files should be coming from /BookingEDI and all Shipment files should be coming from /ShipmentEDI.  If that is true, do you need the filename to be part of the routing process?  Or is there another distinct route the data can take currently, based on the filename?

My hope is that if the above is correct, and that there are only two possible paths (Booking vs. Shipment) that the folder the data is picked up from can be used to route it, rather than the filename.  Otherwise we have to update the routing rules every time a new version of the filename comes along.

2.)The input file has UTF-8 encoding but the map is using Cp1252 encoding.When I changed the input file encoding to match the map encoding the map
was able to translate the input file(PID 057acdfa-cdc4-488d-b038-2ddb8bc2934a) having special character without any issues.
As there is a mismatch in the encoding between input file and MAP encoding it was not able to process the file with special character.
Kindly correct the input file encoding as per map encoding.

I don't know why you are conditioning the N1 on the ShipToAddlName. This is an optional field and will usually not have data. If the ENTST record is present the N1 segment should be mapped.

Were the source filenames given below not sufficient?

I can also give source message ID's but I don't see any PID's.

That said, I may have answered my own question in looking for them

I noticed that Source Filename: ATHOME_Sea_NBW1I03115_20190305205957.XML shows Source Folder: toIBM.
Source Filename: ModeTrP_SeaSm_MJW1I03011_201903051860714.XML shows Source Folder:  /Prod/ASN.

Doesn't that indicate that they use two separate dataflows, rather than filenames?  If that is true, then instead of using filenames for The Room Place (and Seabox, and any other ones we want routed like Room Place), couldn't we just say anything that is pulled from /Prod/ASN gets routed like Room Place, and not touch the At Home routing at all?

Don't change anything in Production yet, but is that theory valid?

I've explained on sametime multiple times already that when we run the traces requested we don't see anything on the JVM and thus the logs from the search server are empty.  I have also explained that we do not go through a webserver to goto search, we go direct to the jvm which listens on 3737.  If you explain how to turn on the access logs in the JVM I can do that (I did try previously but it didn't seem to work). 

I've explained all of this in sametime several times but it seems those updates aren't getting pasted into the PMR so i'll now deal directly in the PMR.

This has been going on for far to long can we please arrange a webex with reasonable time for me to join (i.e. not 30 mins notice via the tool).

Please note the EDI contact at the TP is away until May 2nd and will not be looking at the timescale from Toshiba's perspective until he returns.  I will update this ticket when I have more news but I suspect I won't know any more for at least 2 weeks.

Given the number of maps involved will it be possible to do the ORDERS, ORDCHG & ORDRSP maps first and have these available for testing while you progress DESADV, INVOICE and then the INVRPT/SLSRPT maps.  It is quite possible that Toshiba cannot start work for a few weeks so you may have them all done before we can start testing, but I would like to do them in this order just in case we are ready earlier.

You are right. Upon further investigation, even though the Metadata1 exists in the file, a possible reason for it to not load into OFS could be the value '1' in position 213 of the UNB segment. This field usually contains a 'T' or a 'P' indicator for Test or Production and doesn't work when it's 'T' or '1' (as in this case).
Could you please remove the mapping for this position (213) in CTE and reprocess the same file that Julie did last week?
I will then check to see if that helps load the file successfully into OFS?

In this particular case (Ericsson), please see the attached screenshot that I can see on our internal EAI site where in it clearly shows the Metadata1 has been Hardcoded to ?SE? (for Sweden).
Since this implementation first went live for Sweden, I believe they did not use the above mentioned logic on country code in UNB & Metadata1.
I am positive that ?SE? is hardcoded in the JMS settings for the map. Please confirm if this is correct after you have verified it.
I have to follow up with an MCR as soon as you confirm it as it is an urgent requirement at this time and we are unable to test for other countries in CTE due to this issue.

Please test this file and let us know if it matches your requirements.

 

The only segment that may cause a problem is the ?UNH/UNT? number. We are not sure how we should specify it. è We use our internal orderID, in order to be unique and incremental.

Update to the logic - Please follow this new logic as it will make sure that any scenario we experience will be with the correct prepack quantity
Instead of looking for the smallest value in the SLN segment - we want IBM to simply take the first SLN segment quantity and divide it by the pack ratio. 
For example going back to the PO1 segment attachment you will simply divide 90 by 2 to get the 45 in the PO1 segment. 
This will work even if the first line item had quantity 45 because the pack ratio would be 1 so dividing 45 by 1 would give you 45 in PO1 segment.

I hope you'll fix the GET /store/{storeId}/cart/@self/usable_shipping_mode operation as well, It's also slow and maybe add some parameter to control if it should exclude / include ship modes with no/zero cost.

Thank you for starting your work on this one. You may use PID 56516584 for Verifone IFTMIN files (Receiver Id : CEVADVERI in CTE) or you can also use Illumina as a sample for the output layout as they are all the same IFTMIN positional file format.
Just make sure to ensure that you follow the Paper map as there are some changes in the mapping (when compared to Illumina or Verifone IFTMIN output files.)

Regarding the AS2 connection, we are currently receiving daily files from GEODIS via the AS2 for the IFCSUM's that load into Worldport. You can search them by using the same ISA sender id (GEOSCO) and Receiver ID CEVAUS in both Production and CTE. As we are now implementing this for Canada, the only difference will be in the ISA/GS Receiver Id's (""CEVACA"") for the IFTMIN into OFS.

Let me know if you have any questions or feel free to call me.

Thanks,
Ramesh

This is high severity observation raise by Global info security team and as a result of this this, venerability may be exploited and will result in non compliance. This will also impact future releases because stake holders will refrain from putting more into non complaint infrastructure.

The only logic I really need to have is the invoiced quantity needs to be the received quantity on the 856. The file I provided as an example will be used to map the 856 incoming for us. I know this is not much to work with, so if you really need an output file from Hypertherm for an 856, I can ask them to provide me with that and rather have a separate mapping rather than using the same 810 file.

A test input file was processed for SmartWool in CTE earlier today at 11:47 am.
There were many PO's in this file with many SDQ segments.
Te output for the 'Z111' text at the orderLine level seems to be mapping the value from PO1*BO for one of the PO1 lines for a PO to the orderLine output for all of the orderLines, instead of mapping the value from the PO1*BO in the associated PO1 segment. The orderline for each PO1 segment should have a different value but it is the same for all orderlines on a PO.

PLease correct.

We tested 810 map and found issues in IT108 and IT109 fields. Kindly use following logic to fix the mapping.

Mapping Logic for IT108 and IT109 fields:

If IT103 = EA then 

IT108 = UP
IT109 = map 12 digit UPC code from E2EDP19002/IDTNR where E2EDP19002/QUALF:7 = UP

Else 

IT108 = UP
IT109 = Map 13 digit UPC code from E2EDP19002/IDTNR where E2EDP19002/QUALF:7 = HE


IF IT103 = CS then 

IT108 = UK
IT109 = map 14 digit GTIN code from E2EDP19002/IDTNR where E2EDP19002/QUALF:7 = UK

We tested 810 map and following two issues were found. Please refer to PID #? 23596749 in CTE and fix the mapping.

1.) IT108 and IT109 fields are not getting mapped (Same mapping logic is present in CD_US_HARBOR_WHOLESALE_O_810_5010 map in CTE).
2.) SAC segment is not required when SAC05 is Zero.

There are a few corrections required for the 850 mapping:
1.      Add mapping of ?ZTP? to /processSalesOrder/dataArea/salesOrder/orderHeader/incoTermsCode
2.      T07 missing with N9*DP or REF*DP 

Also, the mapping has to be updated to handle all types of orders so I am providing a completely revised 850 template.
Most of the changes are highlighted in blue but please review the entire template and adjust the mapping accordingly.
Please note that there can be one of two SoldTo numbers for Dillards depending on teh type of order designated by the BEG02 segment.
The Roadrunner mapping also has similar logic in place for the soldto lookup to determine which soldto number to assign to 'tradingPartnerReferenceID' and 'soldToCustomerID'.

TS001551438,SGCIO,Customer,"Hello Rajeev ,

Sequence number logic is working fine .

We have to do two more changes :
1) For 715G and 715H field : 
Sorry , I am asking you to revert the changes made at field 715G ,715H field  .
==> Map 715G field as before from E2EDP08/VENUM and keep 715H blank .

2) For 714B field :
          Remove the space before 714B for below two combinations of Supplier -ship to code only :
A)SUP_CODE =""T9UZE"" and  Var_Ship_To = ""44279""
B)SUP_CODE =""T9UZN""  and Var_Ship_To = ""47284""

     when Supplier -ship to combination is not same as above then keep the two spaces between 714A and 714B field as present today in prod .

Use CTE PID : 33180719 ,33176339 for testing .

Dillards has not received the 870 for Eagle Creek. They have also checked the Inovisworks website and did not see an Eagle Creek document.
Please check and confirm that it was sent. 
When I view the Event Details for the SmartWool transmission it references a Mailslot number, but the Event Details for the Eagle Creek transmission does not.
If there are further issues please follow up with Inovis to correct.

Also, there are some issues with the 870 translations for documents processed on 3/22 and 3/25:
1.      The BSR 03 needs to contain the Dillard's purchase order number ? this should be mapped from customerOrderID
2.      The CTT01 is a count of the HL segments and should be two vs. one.

We attempted some changes to the input file and resent to Verizon, but still there are issues. The Verizon EDI expert is back in the office next week.

Question 1: Can your team support a debug session with Verizon on Thursday, May 9th to resolve the 856 issue?

Please let us know what times would work for you that are in business hours US East Coast time (from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm EDT).


In parallel to the 856 work, we are trying to transmit the Inbound 850/Reverse PO - the first one we need for commercial use. We sent the file today, but Verizon shows no record of receiving it. I have attached the input file to this case for reference.

At least one of N102 or N103 is required.     THIS IS A CONDITIONAL STATEMENT?

We attempted to send an updated 856 .csv to Verizon today using the Outlook mail box.

Can you check on your side if you see the transmission attempt coming from our Verizon EDI email address?  Can you check if this was then mapped and transmitted to Verizon?

Verizon responded after we attempted 856 transmission that they did not see any file from us.

I have already shared the clear mapping instructions.

1.) I had already updated in my last comments that MTX01 is getting mapped in place of MTX02. Kindly fix this mapping. 

2.) PO102, PO103, PO104, ACK02 and ACK03 mapping is not correct. These values should be mapped from E2EDP01008 loop where VPREI ((getting mapped to PO104)) field is not ZERO. 

Refer to PID #? 23782555 in CTE.

I reviewed the 214 and the format looks great.   I'm following up with the business here regarding the changed content.   Just one question on the changes.   The N102, N102, and N104 have a value of ""C"".   I'm not sure what ""C"" means but suspect it is wrong.   Should those have a value of ""X"" as they are conditionally required fields?

I can mark up the 204.  I just need the NFI PDF converted to a format I can edit (like RTF).   Do you have a PDF reader that will allow you to convert the format?   I attached a copy of the NFI PDF.

Also, when you test next, use the invoice file associated with PID 1a6f1936-a589-4a6d-acb9-356055f0e4cd. It is ISA 100004813 / GS 100004814.

Another thing, when I sent the EDI file with ISA 100004813 to CTE, nothing happened. Is CTE set up to look for a different ISA/GS for this trading partner?

The files are still failing to translate correctly. Each output file should be generated based on each unique PONo field in the source file. It appears the map is translating each row of data independent of each row of data. 

We dropped another test ""uTrade_PO_Report_02072019.csv"" and reference number 319410 was generated in 2 separate output files. This is an example of where the the PONo field is unique and only one output file should be generated. The output file should contain line details from both records in source file and IBM should only generate one output file.  

I'm available to join a call now to review as we need to begin testing ASAP.

I think we just identified the root cause behind why the Sandvik files are not loading into OFS correctly.
It looks like you have configured the JMS Doc type as 'Booking_XML' where as it should have been IFTMIN_FF' as mentioned in the PER. The Booking_XML is only the Inflight Doc Type and should not be used as a JMS setting.

Ocado have now sent an ORDHDR to our Production EDI mailbox, but we can?t see it and I am now, not sure what is the best IBM way to progress this? ?
eg. Can IBM see anything in Ocado?s EDI mailbox directly / or maybe communicating with Ocado?s EDI service provider (I?m not sure who that is?)
Let me know what you think is the best next step?

FOR REF: Ocado?s implementation process doesn?t fit into the usual IBM implementation procedure, involving a test environment etc.

Yes Ocado testing will be carried out using our Production Mailbox
I know it doesn't sound particularly professional, but this is the only way Ocado said they could send us a ""test"" EDI order. Ocado said they would make sure the delivery date on the Test EDI order was well out into the future, which would minimize the chance of anything being delivered -  as long as I make sure Silver Spoon Customer Services are aware - which I will be doing. Please go ahead the and move the Ocado EDI order map into Production (5052409010000) to receive ORDHDR messages

Thank you

Can you please confirm as soon as the Metadata1 issue has been fixed on your side and sent to EAI via MQ? Also, please reprocess the last successful input file received from the customer so I can track it internally.
The customer is waiting anxiously on our feedback and we haven't made any progress in about a week.

TS001651756,British Sugar Plc,Customer,"?Hello

Thanks for the Test Ocado EDI data that you have processed. I have looked at this and am happy that we can migrate the map to not only the Test CTE InFlight environment (5052409019997), but also to our EDI Live Prodn InFlight environment (5052409010000). This is not because I know the EDI map is now 100% accurate, but because (surprisingly), Ocado can only send test Ocado Tradacoms EDI orders, as Live (ie. ?ORDHDR?) EDI orders to our Live EDI mailbox (ie. 5052409010000).
Sandhya 

Please let me know when the map has been migrated to Prodn InFlight and I will ask Ocado to send a test EDI order.

To be clear, even though I have asked for the EDI order map to be put in Live Inflight environment, I may well need to request further tweaks to the map

 
Thank you & Regards

We followed the instructions you provided and thought we had done it successfully.  However, when we informed Verizon that we had sent the first test file, they asked where we had sent the file as they did not see the file on their test AS2 system.

Can you check to see if we did send the file correctly?  If so, can you tell me where I can Verizon that it was sent?

If you do not see the file being sent today, can you send the file to Verizon?  I would not think it would matter if we initiate the transfer or if you initiate the transfer as we are not using the final GUI anyways.  I have attached the .csv we tried to send - IDM_RevPO_TEST1.csv as the test file.

?I asked Verizon for the test files.  Verizon responded that they will only proceed with the EDI testing one step at a time.

So, they will not provide all of the test files and we can not complete all of the IDEMIA inputs as you requested.

Therefore, can you enable IDEMIA to send EDI transmissions with the first test being the Verizon Inbound EDI 850 Reverse RO/Input File request for which we provided the test file?

Once this 850 transmission (Step 1) is successful, then we will move on to the next step in the process and test it until that step is correct.

TS001763838,Sigma-Aldrich Corporation,Customer,"Hi Manju,

I am reopening this case as we found this issue today after customer reported. This is a small logic miss at mapping. Please refer to mapping spec ""YoungIn_Korea_FlatFile_IDOC_ORDRSP_cXML_Mapping Spec_v1.1"" where the logic is updated at Row 35.
- For cXML field ""ConfirmationRequest/ConfirmationItem/ConfirmationStatus/"" Loop on ""E1EDP01/E1EDP20""
Which would mean create as many Confirmation status as E1EDP20 under E1EDP01.

This was spotted when we notice - there was an item confirmed for 2 different dates, but IBM only picks up the first one with earlier date.

Note: Can we request you to also change this Logic in Sungwoo map.?

Thank you,

Thanks for your response. 

I don't understand why there is a sender and/or receiver check as it is a simple AS2 connection with a unique filename that is only used for this interface. All other integration tools are able to handle such interfaces, but not STERLING. There is even no mapping on STERLING. It should just forward the files. Incredibly weak tool!

Anyway, I'll ask  Esphere if they can do anything.

You can use the same concept here as TLSCHEM. For E.g.,

TS001299822,Louisiana Pacific Corporation,Customer,"Hi Rick - 

So yes, I do agree that it's best to separate the map. Here's my dilemma, how can IBM tell when to use the Commerce Hub map vs Lowes map? In our system, the EDI is triggered under Lowes from our system. However, Commerce Hub (CH) only comes into play when it s specific order type. I'm unsure how to tell IBM how to differentiate the EDI 856 ASN to send to CH vs Lowes other than the receiver id are different. Other than the control list determines the RCVPRN = CH will be Commerce Hub.  Please let me know your thoughts. This is high priority as we have now have Commerce Hub orders that needs their ASN and we backed out the map so the regular Lowes will send (those are higher volume than CH orders).

Two things.

1)  Usually, we do internal testing before we're ready to start end-to-end.  If we keep the default as the VAN, would CTE always be set up to NOT actually send to the trading partner unless we request that?

2)  Sometimes we may want to do mass testing for outbound documents.  If we keep the default as the VAN, would we just request them to be sent to the test FTP folder if needed?

E2J3K03                                                       01419691231 

The other corrections are present in CTE so it looks like the map was loaded but something is causing the date to be off and to populate on the YFSO order types when we should only see it on a YFCQ.

We have 1 mapping change on the 940. We need to include the following mapping of the Batch number at the line item level.

On the 940, populate the segment N9 with qualifier LT when there is a value in the field CHARG in the IDoc Segment E2VPPII. In this example, the Batch number is 1234579.

N9*LT*12345679~

I found some time to go forward with this project.

So far the requested changes are working.

When those new attributes are used it will be a different custom configuration so the PO1 and PID description will let them know where to pivot.

Also, A_KEY_STYLE and   KEY_CODE_TYPE_GMK_MK are mutually exclusive by custom config., so the duplication should never occur.

thanks - I just tested this - PID none - but source message ID = 1ddf2fc5-4983-11e9-af46-2dc38086e953

What's looking strange is, that you took a ORDERS message as an input file for the ORDRSP. Thus the output is missing some entries.

I just provided a few more input files in CTE. The failed - maybe because they are of type ORDRSP not ORDERS, as tested above.

This request was for Sungwoo only. Reason is, the developer who built the Sungwoo map is Sangily - who also built the Young IN frontier map for PO confirmation.

Young In frontier had an issue with Line item where map was not picking up the right quantiy and line number from the IDOC.

We suspect the same issue is there in Sungwoo map and we cannot test in production.
Request you to transfer this to same developer to verify and confirm if Sungwoo map is clean and no such issue with Line level logic.

This is a  pro active check.

We have a small update to map logic ( which was incorrect before). We found it after customer highlighted. Logic update:
Please refer to MRS ""SungWoo_Korea_FlatFile_IDOC_ORDRSP_cXML_Mapping Spec_v1.4"" at Row 35.

I have tested and found few issues in it.

Scenario 1: If GDERR - error code in D1 record position 201 is present, data should populate the output BAK02 based on the scenario mentioned  whether its Rejected or Accepted with Error.

Below PID is tested and Rejection error code is available in D1 Record position 201 but output came as ""AT""- accepted. PID - 24347083.

D1 record position 201 - Error code
D1 record position 203 - Error message

Kindly resolve this issue as this is high priority and make changes accordingly, if needed.

There are some changes to the shipping tolerance check logic which I mentioned as part of point 4 in my email on 20th march. Pls ignore those changes and find the revised logic below:

Shipping Tolerance check
   Include logic that ?if? shipping cost (SAC05) is either 30% or  $10, greater of the two ?then"" the EDI transactions need to get failed in IBM itself with a custom error message and an email stating ""Amazon transaction failed due to shipping cost exceeding thershold.

Warehouse will be sending to us the plant number in the PER02 segment.

Map what is in the PER02 segment to EDI segment and fieldname E1MBXYI/WERKS on to the XML idoc number.

Let me know when updated in CTE.

Thanks,

Anthony

Can you look further into this issue for us?  Please review the e-mail attachment where we've had something like this similar before with extra spaces.  You pull up the XML file, but you don't see the spaces.  When we originally setup the XML files with IBM they had to add in some changes to fix this problem for us.

I know we are talking about a '#?' being added in at the end.  This is a new message type and basic type we are creating for the EDI 945.  Just wondering if you have to add in something like you did before where you removed extra spaces where you have to remove the '#?' at the end.

We are not doing anything on our end to add in the '#?'.

Also, we are getting this:

<IDOC BEGIN=""1"" >#??

We need this:

<IDOC BEGIN=""1"">

Let me know.

Thanks,

We have two challenges for the inbound - 1) in the legacy system the partner profile is the vendor number, 2) but in the new system the IDOC has been set up as a Logical System - US_GENTRAN, so we lose the vendor number in the partner profile set up. Yes, we introduced the REF02 segment in PO and requested the vendor to echo it back on the 855 and 810 for this reason. I can see how this adds a wrinkle in the existing lookup logic for the legacy system. 

I am open to any suggestions.

Thank you for this explanation. I wasn't 100% sure how the lookup was happening. In the new SAP system they have defined the Partner Profile differently than the legacy system for PO related EDI. In the new SAP they set up a Logical System (LS) called US_GENTRAN for all vendors, this is why I referenced looking at the REF02 value (REF01= IA) so I am not sure how you want to set this up in the lookup.

I have updated the LEHIGH_SNDPRN_LOOKUP.xml file with Applied, Wesco, and Fastenal vendor numbers for the 855 (uploaded file = LEHIGH_SNDPRN_LOOKUP_FrankUpdated.xml)

We have more map changes we need on the EDI 945.  A while back you created for us two maps for the EDI 945 which we will need.

If the W0501 segment has ""N"" then we will want the map TANDL_WHSE_I_945_4010 that has message type SHPCON.

If the W0501 segment has ""R"" then we will want the map TATLYL_WHSE_I_945_4010 that has message type WMMBXY.

Let me know when updated in CTE.

Also, can you email me about the other thing I mention where we are not receiving from the warehouse the test EDI 945's in CTE and how we can go about handling that.

Thanks,

Need map changes made for EDI 945 having message type WMMBXY.

In W1208 segment will be our SAP material number.

If you have any of the following SAP material numbers from W1208 make EDI segment E1MBXYI/BWART = ""101"":

1400010134800
1400010534800

1400011634800
1400011834800
1400100240300

If you don't have any of the SAP material numbers mentioned above make E1MBXYI/BWART = ""901"".

If you have number that starts with first two digits = ""84"" in W0604 you always make E1MBXYI/BWART = ""651"".

You did not remove the pre-processor program in production.   You reverted to an earlier version of the pre-processor programs.   I will rerun the test against the ASNPLT file and request the TP to validate the data.   They were happy with the last test and hopefully they will be happy with this test too.  :)

If I am understanding correctly the ASNPLT was using the pre-processor map that was removed from production.  That is actually the correct pre-processor to use for this project.  The problem we had was a change we put in for a specific TP caused an issue with everyone else.   The original pre-processor had to be applied to a new map so that we could process their EDI ASN's.  please let me know if I am misunderstanding you.

IT1*07 = map from E1EDP19 902 -> IDTNR

Apologize for the inconvenience. 

As per the current mapping N101 contains the constant ""BY"" and N102 is mapped to H1 record position 48. 

Please remove the current mapping of N102 from H1 record for the N101 - value ""BY"" (only BY, rest of the values like ST remain in same mapping) and map to H2 record position 33 to 62 as mentioned in MCR.

Business rule: Buyer information need to populate from H2 record when N101 value is BY.

Please let me know if you need more clarification on this.

I could not relocate the ticket for Stoli to re-open and i am adding to the Parent so that you can open under the NDA. The conundrum is that IL is going live on 4/1. They are currently using CSG_STOL_O_850_4010 and we plan to move them to the Generic map and both IL and NV will use 12/9544369200(T) like what FL is currently in PRD...but all other houses/states will remain with the current ISAs.

  IBM sent their first 852 today and we did not receive it. Can you check if there is something received that I cannot see in Inflight? Looks like the transaction was sent at 2:37AM.


I?ll need to open a ticket with opentext.

All I have at this point is the ISA control number 000440106, time 2:37 am eastern, and the EDIINT MessageID.

   There is a small issue with the date time format on the 852. The 861 seems to be formatted correctly, but the 852 is wrong.

The field DEVICE_DTTIME is in the wrong format. It should look like the 861. Is this a quick fix? We are hoping to fix it immediately so we can ready for the map migration next week.

We only wanted the new coding that was just added to map FOB01 to the ?H1/ZTTXLN field removed.  But apparently they also removed the coding we had in place to stop mapping everything to H1/ZTTXLN.  We are not receiving the SAC codes and amounts correctly anymore.  

See PID 36843599 and compare it to PID 36776372 on CTE.

you can keep the logic for location code lookup and no changes is required. In my test case, the value is ?AN01047610978.XXX

The value ?AN01047610978.XXX is not found in the MM location file. So you default the ShipToLocation to LOCDEFAULT. Therefore, the lookup value is ?AN01047610978.LOCDEFAULT

I have setup AN01047610978.LOCDEFAULT to use sold to = 70100561, bill to = 70104897 and ship to = 70102409 in the MM location file.

The source file has ship to id is S901 and the map should pick up sold to , bill to and ship to from the MM_location table. The mapping is not happening and we need you to check on this error. 

We are not pushing the responsibility of updating the MM_Location table to you. As you have already been copied in the email chain to Stephen and Lidia, the MM_Location table  has already been updated with the setup values. Stephen has already confirmed it more than 2 times.

How to check MM_Location table on our end. This table is giving us too many issues. I have already attached 20190212_IBM_LOCATION.xlsx to this ticket. We need you to look in the issue more clearly and help to advise an solution.

Unless, there is way we can verify the entries in MM_LOCATION table, we cannot proceed further with this limited information. These are the values we look up for your support.

I am not sure what you mean but PLEASE review the original case (TS000892025) and the PER.

The first ISA/GS ID is for the IHC Standard Accounts...
ISA Qualifier/ID ? ZZ/ERXIMTHC
GS ID ? ERXIMTHC

The second ISA/GS ID if for the IHC Virtual Warehouse accounts...
ISA Qualifier/ID ? ZZ/ERXIMTHCVW
GS ID ? ERXIMTHCVW

All this should already be setup due to the old case. If you have any other questions please call me.

I attempted to retransmit POs on the new EDI connection and received a no envelope error (ts002068599). When looking into the invoices they most recently sent, they were transmitted through the previous connection for vendor 0000045668 (12 4157771997) which should now be disconnected.

Please confirm that 12 4157771997 is now disconnected for vendor 0000045668 and the IDs in the attached PER are now live.

As we have it set up this way, I don't want to ask the partner to change, as the testing is almost complete - I would expect a few more 997's like this to arrive over the next few days.

I've seen this on previous tickets, and I have to ask; why is this expectation on Thermos? 

I've utilized Sterling Commerce in this exact same role at two of my previous shops and there was not an expectation for the customer to provide the enveloping load sheets. While I understand that there may be differing tiers of support at different shops, it would seem that based on the financial expenditure that Thermos dedicates to our relationship with Sterling that this sort of basic enveloping functionality would be the responsibility of Sterling Commerce.

In our 856 input file data every line in position 48 as a value either SOTI or STOI, which depicts the way the ASN data is structured.
SOTI has the records format as 5700, 6000, & 7000
STOI has the records format as 6000, 5700 & 7000
I apologize, early in the development of the map I had to mock test data and I may have used the wrong format in my mocked data, although towards the end we did test with data flowing through our ERP test instance and it should have been structured correctly.

In the case of Moen, the records are formatted as SOTI and should have the rows showing as 5700, 6000 and then 7000 records.
We have had two failures to date in production PID #?s 1116181679 & 1117182195.

The current situation is that they are no longer intending to handle EDI directly and will be using a VAN as their provider, including mapping.  They are deciding which VAN to use in the next month and once this has been sorted out they will commence the necessary work.  At this moment in time I have no idea how long this might take but I suspect we are looking at a couple of months minimum.

So we need to put this on hold until then.  The setup will change from AS2 to VAN but everything else should be the same.

Anyway, Shipper codes are limited (5 or 6) and should come from the N104 code that is provided in the mapping spec. Only Consignee City codes and Consignee city codes not found are to be mapped from the other codelists.

If you are looking for San Diego in the Consignee codelist, then the Airport code for it is 'SAN'.
If it is the Shipper, then do the conversion as given in the paper map for the Shipper codes.

Let me know if you have any questions. Also please send me the finalized list when it is ready.

Secondly, refer PID: faa62704-29a8-4755-9354-6de5f973ba53 and you will notice that the output file has 'SDF' for Miraloma in the Consignee city, which is incorrect. It should be 'SNA' where as it is showing 'SDF' which is actually for Louisville.
Please fix this and let me know when it is done. Also, send me the updated codelists after you are done.

What is the ""default"" for sending 997s in CTE?  What about other outbound documents (i.e. 810, 855, 856)?

Now that we are fully on SaaS, exactly how should we specify it in the case when we need to have certain documents sent to the customer automatically in CTE?  Also, exactly how do we specify when we want to change it back to NOT send, after we are done testing?

TS001150880,Premier Farnell Ltd.,Customer,"Hi Bijoy

One of the maps is PF_O_E_SLSRPT_D97A_AU4.
The others will be similar but end CN4, IN4, SG4 I believe. They should all be the same though. The only thing that changes is the NAD+BY segment.

PID for the AU4 map is 31d24260-4cf9-418d-8094-9931101db9cd 

This is CTE not PROD

I realise the the N/A in the NAD+PC segment is a default when the mapped XML element is blank.  My question is around the mandatory/conditional requirements for the segment.

TS001150880,Premier Farnell Ltd.,Customer,"TP have o/s questions regarding the use of 'N/A' for the name/address elements on the NAD+PC segment.  

Can you confirm something with me please?

Am I correct in thinking that the NAD segment in D97A has 3 sections holding names/address elements  (C058, C080 and C059).  The standards I can see imply that these 3 elements are optional, however the sub-elements show as mandatory (1).   Exactly what does this mean?

Does it mean that NAD+PC+123456++++London++SW1 5AA+UK'  is valid but
NAD+PC+123456+:100 Any Street:Fulham+++London++SW1 5AA+UK' is not valid (because the first sub-element of C058 is missing but the second and third are not null??

The TP has stated that the delivery fee needs to remain as a line item.  Please see PID 15316470 on 3/26 in CTE.  All looks good here and the changes to make a G72 line should not be in play.  

Also, the $$ value is not showing up in the line item and should pull from E2EDp26 003 BETRG populating the G83 07 like all other lines.
I believe MD made some changes, to populate in the G72...but has since changed their mind and appears the changes need to be backed out and populate the $$ :)

Does the mapper review MRS while mapping because when we request map changes, we update the MRS and highlight the change requested.  If MRS is not looked up then we may have to explicitly explain the element is at Header or Detail level.  Which we will do in future if that helps save time for both parties.

I have a question for you. I am assuming that you have setup the map to support the UTF-8 encoded format, right? Refer PID where in Visteon sent us some special characters in the N3 segment of the Shipper address. Even though the map translation did not fail, the N3 address did not show up in the output file. So, I need you to please confirm #?1. if the map currently supports UTF-8 encoding and #?2. Fix the part in the output so the N3 or any other segment with a special character will get populated in the output as-is.

Please get back to me as soon as you can on this one.

Thank you,

Looks like we need one last change.. based on their specs, ACK04 and ACK 05 are only mandatory when ACK01 =DR or IB.  IF ACK01= DR or IB, DTM 118 or 067 need to be mapped into ACK 04/05. From my knowledge we don't use either DR or IB so this shouldn't be an issue. 

When ACK01 is not DR or IB can we remove the mapping? ?

Sorry I correct my statement, I guess the mapping was missing for some lookup values including the new one that was added. I missed to look for this value during the testing. This was not populating in the test output too.

During testing we noticed an issue with the 945 

See PID  23814735 from today
I couldn't figure out where the miss was happening

I've attached the MRS, Input and current output and expected output.

The output should have  6 E2VPDLI001 lines on the the output.   
It seems that the map summed the lines if the product was the same.
It should output 1 E2VPDLI001 for each  LX loop

Thanks,

As per mapping perspective everything looks good.

I have one last change, ONLY for look up value IP043190110.

File with IP043190110 lookup value will be coming into IBM with the following filename: INTERPLANT_erp07_erp04_856_*******.*** and can you change the destination filename to na_erp13_flr_corp_856_**************.in .
Whereas other lookup values will be coming in with INTERPLANT_erp07_erp13_856_******.**** file name itself and destination filename can remain the same as well na_erp13_flr_aft_856_**************.in

Please let me know in case of any concerns. once this change is made in TEST I Will perform the testing.

Two issues: 1) These PIDs (63629819, 63629820, & 63628814) are in a failed status in CTE - ConnectDirect issue? The files translated and output is available...

2) The logic for DIRDEB is almost correct (PID 63629820):

I assume BPR13 is not correct (same ABA in 'BB' and 'BA' details so can't 100% sure), but for sure BPR15 is not being mapped correctly. For DIRDEB, BPR13 and BPR15 should be mapped from E1IDB02-FIIQUALI = 'BA'.

* map the PAYEE (recv'ing funds) ABA number 
IF EDIDC40-MESTYP = 'DIRDEB' and E1IDB02-FIIQUALI = 'BA' and E1IDB02-FIIBKUKN is present, map E1IDB02-FIIBKUKN to BPR13.
ELSEIF map E1IDB02-FIIBKENN to BPR13.

* map the PAYEE (recv'ing funds) bank acct number
IF EDIDC40-MESTYP = 'DIRDEB' and E1IDB02-FIIQUALI = 'BA' , map E1IDB02-FIIKONTO to BPR15.

In SAP, the ABA routing number is mandatory and will be populated in E1IDB02-FIIBKENN. But, if SWIFT or CHIPS codes (used for foreign payments) are also present in the bank details then SAP populates E1IDB02-FIIBKENN with the SWIFT or CHIPS values and moves moves the ABA routing number to E1IDB02-FIIBKUKN. E1IDB02-FIIBKUKN will only be present if a SWIFT or CHIPS value is present. When this occurs based on our current logic, the wrong value will be mapped in the EDI 820 file.

Please make the following change on E1IDB02:
If E1IDB02-FIIQUALI = 'BA' and E1IDB02-FIIBKUKN is present, map E1IDB02-FIIBKUKN to BPR09, else map E1IDB02-FIIBKENN.
If E1IDB02-FIIQUALI = 'BB' and E1IDB02-FIIBKUKN is present, map E1IDB02-FIIBKUKN to BPR13, else map E1IDB02-FIIBKENN.

It'll be the same directory setup that they have today for EDI820s. I cannot view the directories - incoming/EDIUS820 and incoming/EDICA820 perhaps (based other setups I've seen for BOA)? On the BOA side their setup requires a username to be assigned to the accounts, but the SFTP setup remains the same. So for the new accounts we assigned them to lhmateri to avoid clashes with the existing accounts under lhcement.

To clarify, from the new system we'll send PRS_US_* or PRS_CA_* and IBM will rename it SAP_US_BOA_* or SAP_CA_BOA_* (values after * follows the existing renaming script in place for BOA).

Good call out on the SFTP ID. This was discussed with BOA at length and yes we will use lhmateri, which is neccessary because of how BOA has associated new accounts on their side.

Regarding the renaming of files, again we had several back and forth conversations with BOA on this and I did confirm with Jyothi that we'd rename these files to mirror the existing setup.

From Lehigh SAP_CA_820PYO_CADS1_20190114_24712700.xml, Renamed at IBM for BOA to SAP_CA_BOA_820PYO_CEM_20190114_1316866203.dat.
From Lehigh SAP_US_820PYO_CEM-S_20190115_24721905.xml, Renamed at IBM for BOA to SAP_US_BOA_820PYO_CEM_20190115_24721902.dat.

Going forward in the new system, we will only use the LEHIGH_BOACA-CEMG_O_820_4010 or LEHIGH_BOAUS-CEMG_O_820_4010 maps. Based on the filename from the new system (PRS), the routing will look like this:

If the file name starts with PRS_US, then use map LEHIGH_BOAUS-CEMG_O_820_4010
If the file name starts with PRS_CA, then use map LEHIGH_BOACA-CEMG_O_820_4010 

With exception to the first 3 digits of the filename (SAP or PRS), the naming convention is the same as in the existing system PR1. 
I have renamed the test files properly (according the program) and uploaded them here again.

It is Jyothi and my preference that we keep one translation map for both systems, the project is already planning to do regression testing and we'll perform regression testing in both systems in the future should changes need to be made. 

You stated ""Translation map will need to be changed or a new one created that will look for and map the D for Debit as well as the C as it always has."" As I mentioned, I looked at the 820 MRS and the logic to handle the debit and credit indicator is already there and the data in the PAYEXT and DIRDEB has been configured to support the existing logic. Can someone confirm that the logic is there (I provided where it is in the MRS in my previous response)? The test files I have provided will test this logic. 

Please run the test files thru the existing map and if we need to make changes we can do so.

To clarify, there are no changes expected in the map as long as the logic (below in boldface) in the 820 MRS is working. The SAP system is configured pass 'ACH' in EXTPAYM and 'PPD' in EXTDESC for DIRDEB IDocs and the map logic will take care of the rest.

[MRS] Output tab :: Row 5
if E1IDKU3.EXTPAYM = ""CHK"" then Hardcode ""C""

if E1IDKU3.EXTPAYM = ""ACH"" then
 (if E1IDKU3.EXTDESC = ""PPD"" then hardcode ""D""

We started testing with OC Tanner today, and I noticed a discrepancy in envelope ids. OpenText is not using the test ids that OC Tanner had indicated in their guidelines. They are using the id OCTANNERNCM instead. Rather than changing all the envelopes in CTE, I was planning to manually send the outbound test data through the VAN, but my 997 failed on the VAN. I think it is because OCTANNERNCM is not setup on the Sterling VAN. Can you confirm that? If that is the case, would you be able to point that to OpenText, or do I need to open a case with L1 for that?

After reading the current map logic, I see that the MB reference will be used to populate the B3.03 value if the MasterBillOfLading is null.

I need to have the logic updated to use the reference value where the qualifier is MB and if there is an entry in the SNI_210_ENTITYID code list.

We successfully tested this document and have been certified by SPS Commerce.
We are waiting for authorization to migrate to production.

I would like to test other scenarios  internally.  As such, I am requesting that the rule that allows documents to go out to the VAN be removed so that my additional tests remain in Finish.dat status. 

Please advise.

We need to determine where Jabil is expecting the last field, the Customer PO in the EDI message.  Once we understand that and agree, we will pass that back to you to update the mapping.

So right now, this ticket should still be awaiting feedback from TGCS.

TS001950357,Whirlpool Corporation,Customer,"Hi Amy,

I've been testing with Informat, and they don't really like the file naming convention that they are receiving for the 846 files. It looks like GIODE is preserving the input file name and is using that as the output file name. So in production, the file name would be something like ""O_510_000000123456789"". They were wondering if they could get a file name like [GS_receiver_id]_846_[sequence_number].txt. So the file names would look like...

0406_846_99999999.txt

The sequence number could be a counter or the idoc number from the input file name...they don't really care. They are really just hoping they can get the GS receiver id in the file name. Would that be possible?

TS001955809,AXIALL CORPORATION,Customer,"Hello IBM,

The fix that was reverted worked. This fix will not affect any other calculations that were previously being done by Timbrmart? I only tested with the failed invoices without freight and am not sure of if it will affect any other invoices.

Do I have to test with an old invoice without freight to verify fully or this is specific to freight?

Thanks

I'm also adding our generic MRS based on the relationship with IBM's MRS and a screen shot as well to help. As I said , we just want the freight charges to be included in the invoice which they are currently not and thus causing the invoices to be ""out of balance"".

It is hard for me with Timbrmart to verify the results. The files all look the same with before and after. Can you just confirm that the issue with the freight change of 9.31 is now being picked up and will have the correct calculation?
If you look at the PDF's attached it shows that the $9.31 freight change is not being calculated . This throws the invoice ""out of balance"" as the client is stating.
The attached invoice has the following warnings:

Hello IBM ,

Which application file can I test with in CTE to add UnitsQuantityShipped = ""1"". Not ""0"" to test in CTE to see if your plan would work?
I tried to change the unit quantity shipped LN:10 Col:1,507 to 1 for file Timbrmart_BO_AXLEXT_810_I_00219_1149576_22976139 X Document.dat

It failed in CTE. Please see Source Message ID 9838751693a67999bnode1 Document Date/Time 03/01/2019 12:57:48

If you know of a file attached or in CTE that will proove your fix can you please send it to me or tell me what change to make?

This way I can first test  by changing the UnitsQuantityShipped = 1  in CTE and see if this works or not.

It looks like the issue still exists. I tested the files I had prior and I still see that the 1% terms were removed and that the /MS was added. Now do I have to download the files from production again and not test with the same ones? The terms must show no matter what map is being used.

Or send me something to test in CTE that you feel that all is OK and I can test files with freight and without freight and see that all is the same as before the change in CTE.

If you change the map for this issue will it affect any other files sent in by Timbrmart? The whole issue was that the invoices with freight. The freight charge was not being calculated . Now the invoices without the freight seem to be missing information and having other information added.
How will this changing of the map affect the 2 different invoices, with and without freight?

I only need the MRS when I have to provide locations for mapping and at the end of the fix after testing so as to have record on hand of the latest MRS so I don't have to request it if I want to investigate something.

If you change the ST envelope will that affect both instances of invoices with and without the freight charge?

we tested the file in CTE and needed further few more changes.

The G1705 field should be hardcoded as PI qualifier and respective G1706 qualifier should populate using Text1 field from LINDTUS_F4104Codeilist.xml where lookup value need to be as ""C_ship to No_item no"".

The Ship to no should be extracted from 2nd occurrence of 6th record type 14th field and item no extracted from 2nd record 50th field.

TS002003573,"Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas,",Customer,"IBM,

One more update we will need for this:

I mention E2E in like E2EDL20.  Anywhere we have that we will want E1E instead.

This is what we will need instead:

EDI segment E1EDL20 is missing for fieldname VBELN. Get that from N902 segment instead.
EDI segment E1EDL20/BOLNR get from N902 segment instead.
For EDI segment E1EDL24/MATNR is missing. Get that from W1208 segment.
For EDI segment E1EDL24/CHARG is missing. Get that from W1209 segment.
For EDI segment E1EDL26/MATNR_LONG is missing. Get that from W1208 segment.

Also, for the other EDI segments make sure they have ""E1E"" instead of ""E2E"" for the first 3 characters of the EDI segment.

Let me know when changes are in CTE.

Thanks,

Anthony

Please refer Production PID : 929400271 that send Delfor file from Id : MERITOROSR001 (SA plant). 

We need similar supplier setup to process SPSO file from South America to Timken France in EDIFACT format. Also, please check existing communication method enabled for Id :1775757487TKFR and use same channel to send out file. Please let me know if additional details required. Thanks!

But, the 810 message for CAT should be using the <to>, <from> and <reference uri=""#?810@""> values within the inbound XML header to detect TP and message type .  IBM currently does the same for almost all outbound messages from us.  The CAT 810 should be configured the same way for CAT outbound 856's.  Here's an example of an outbound CAT 856 (PID#? 6ff35eed-7c17-4c4f-b996-a1de3276c273).

TS002118442,"Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC",Customer,"Hi Bobby,

I got a confirmation from SAP team on this. We want the shipping cost to be mapped to BETRG element within E1EDP26 segment. Additionally BETRG needs to be mapped for both Item cost and shipping cost map. There are some other discrepancies that we found in the IDoc and want to request additional changes below:

- Update BETRG(E1EDP26) = ? SAC- C - ? SAC- A => Summation of Shipping Charges ? Summation of Shipping Allowances - SUMME(E1EDS01) = ? SAC- C - ? SAC- A => Shipping Charges ? Shipping Allowances


Couple of issues which we observed when SUMME or BETRG fields have decimals in it. While it was observed for Item Cost map which I will update in the corresponding ticket(TS001767280), but wanted to make sure that we don't have similar issues in Shipping Cost map.

The mapping of VFDAT as the Lot Number Expiration date in the 856 is needed, however it is not mandatory.

In the 856 mapping, there seems to be a requirement that VFDAT in segment E1MBXYI must be filled with a valid date.  This requirement should allow for a null value 00000000. Not all ASN Idocs from SAP will have a date populated in this field. See the Attached Error Report for an example of when this last occurred.

Inserting comment per your request to add the EDI_DC40 mapping instructions into each case.

As a starting point, use the same mapping as used to build the EDI_DC40 record for the Power and Tel 850 Inbound message.  

In the attached spreadsheet, I listed the EDI_DC40 fields that would have different values from the Power&Tel 850 EDI_DC40 record. Look at the column titled ""UPS 846"" to see what values to update in the EDI_DC40 record for this 846 inbound message.

I ran a 945 test this morning. The mapping step worked but we never received the file in SAP (see Process ID 24635915 in CTE).  I believe the prefix of the file name is missing.

There was an additional request to change the routing rule on IBM for these EDI 810?s which I spoke to Brandon about earlier and agreed on entering post the other mapping changes. Essentially, Amazon will send EDI 810 transaction directly to MuleSoft(via a separate AS2 connection setup between Amazon and ABI). MuleSoft will then send the EDI 810 file to IBM via regular ABI-IBM AS2 outbound connection(File naming convention - Amazon_810_<<datetimestamp>>.txt). The expectation on IBM?s end will be to receive that transaction, translate it and send the translated file back to Mule via IBM-ABI AS2 inbound connection. Can you pls incorporate this additional change? Let me know in case you have any questions.

Use the value passed in N9*4T as the value mapped to the TCODE field.  Remove all other logic for TCODE.  It should be a straight mapping from N9*4T.

See attachment called Mapping_947_to_WMMBID02_Revised_4-8-19.xlsx for the most recent mapping instructions for the TCODE field.

I think what you are seeing in the map may have been done based on the initial mapping instructions and not the most recent.

As a starting point, use the same mapping as used to build the EDI_DC40 record for the Power and Tel 850 Inbound message.  

In the attached spreadsheet, I listed the EDI_DC40 fields that would have different values from the Power&Tel 850 EDI_DC40 record.  Look at the column titled ""UPS 947"" to see what values to update in the EDI_DC40 record for this 947 inbound message.   

Let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks.

In your comments:
There was additional logic that would generate values into the inv.Vendor_SX fields when the REF was missing or when the REF.01 segment contained values other than ""VN"".  This logic has been removed so that only the REF[VN] is used to generate values into these fields.
 
I don't want this logic removed.  I want it executed if no REF*VN is sent.  That is what I was trying to convey with this statement:

These mapping changes should only be executed if the document contains the REF VN. If not, it should follow previous logic.

We found an issue with the 944 map.

The mapping is rolling up all line items in the 944 for the same Product Code (W07*20000*EA**VN*763925~) to a single E2MBXYI entry in the IDoc. 

The logic to map W07 segments from the 944 to an E2MBXYI segment in the IDoc should be:
- If multiple batches exist for the same Material, PO and PO Line Item (batch split), then add all quantities in W07 together to create a single line item quantity in the E1MBXYI segment. 

In the 2 process ID's from CTE listed below, there should be 2 iterations of E2MBXYI in the IDoc sent to SAP because the PO number and/or PO Line Items are different.

A mapping change is needed for the following fields in segment E1MBXYI:

ERFME (Unit of Measure)
If the value on the 944 for Unit of Measure is EA or PCE, then map the value ST in the field ERFME,
Attached are the updated mapping instructions with this change.

MATNR
This field should have leading  zeros to fill out all 18 characters.  For example, the value passed for 764181 should look like 000000000000764181.  

EBELP
This field should have leading  zeros to fill out all 5 characters.  For example, the value passed for 10 should look like 00010.

Thanks.

Inserting comment per your request to add the EDI_DC40 mapping instructions into each case.

As a starting point, use the same mapping as used to build the EDI_DC40 record for the Power and Tel 850 Inbound message.  

In the attached spreadsheet, I listed the EDI_DC40 fields that would have different values from the Power&Tel 850 EDI_DC40 record. Look at the column titled ""UPS 944"" to see what values to update in the EDI_DC40 record for this 944 inbound message.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I am slightly confused by your reply below.  

This should be a brand new setup of 5 message types using TP lookup of AVNET-EMEA and EDI codes of AVNETEMEA:ZZ & AVNETEMEATEST:ZZ for PROD/TEST.  The maps should be the same as those used by AVNETUK at the moment.

You should not be replacing any existing TP's.  
AVNETUK, EBV and EPCOS-ABACUS should remain exactly as they are.

Eventually all of our accounts currently spread across AVNETUK, EBV and EPCOS-ABACUS will be moved to the new TP AVNET-EMEA but you should still have the setup.

I just wanted to make sure that before we get into the PER Request that the requirement is clear.

The file transfers is already in production and works fine right now. I just require a test file transfer to test a project we are working on.

The current process picks the file ""111 Lindt CA - Master items.."" from the folder  ""\\USSRV033\ibm\prod\outbound""
 and transfers it over to ""/usr/sap/temp/LP0/sci/in/prod/inbound""

I need the same process to happen in test where it  picks the file ""111 Lindt CA - Master items.."" from the folder ""\\USSRV033\ibm\test\outbound"" and sends it to ""/usr/sap/temp/LT1/sci/in/prod/inbound""

Would this still require a PER Request? if so how do I submit one?

It still doesn't work.  I've tried several different formats of the data when sending to the mailslot (streaming, CR/LF...) but it either shows 'error' or 'incomplete' at the mailslot.  This mailslot may have been used to connect to an IBM AS400 platform.  We now connect to it using a Windows platform .  I'm not sure if that matters.  Could you check with Level 2 on this.

We send streaming data. That's how our system creates the interchanges.
I sent that non streamed test by manipulating an interchange in Notepad.
We need to be able to send streamed files.

I'm not sure if this will help you, but this mailslot may have previously been used by a different platform (IBM AS400 or IBM i).
We now use a Windows platform to connect to item.

I'm not sure if that makes a difference, but that may have caused us
issues in the past.

I think in the past we may have moved this type of issue to your level 2 support. 

Can we move this up to level 2?

I see that there are batches of more than 1 POs that have the same process ID but that produce different destination filenames. As that was our requirement.

Maybe the validation should not be at process level, maybe this fails when trying to translate each individual file.

Please see my responses for the following questions.

- How would you like the files to appear in infilght?  As CODECO and COARRI message type. Please copy the setup used for Sender ID KBCTC010.
- What SFTP connection should I use to send the files to Westwood? Please place the message in the EDI_IBM\IN folder with the rest of our incoming EDI messages.
- Can I send the filename that Gwangyang uses to send us the data or do you need a different name? You can use the source filename. I have a re-name rule setup that will rename the files.

I'm hoping to locate CODECO/COARRI files with sender ID GWCTWSL.  I provided the BUKOK Sender ID as a reference to see if the new EDI Sender (GWCTWSL) is dropping their files in the same folder for pickup.

I've provided GWCTWSL's  FTP information in a previous message:

FTP Connection Account:  SSZ9C001
Folder name: ""SEND""
IP Address: 209.95.232.130
File name prefix: CODECO_GWCTWSL

Can you please check to see if there are any files from GWCTWSL being picked up?  I do not see these files coming into our system and we are trying to determine if there is missing setup needed to locate and pull the data into IBM for processing.

we do a mid of the BSN*02 and go over 7 and take 4,
Then take the right 4 numbers of the BSN*02

I will need the 944 and the 945 IB maps as well for 226.  
When I send a 940 or 943 to DC 226 in CTE it has to now go to MRPLINDTUST using the same versions of the DC 240 maps in production.  When I receive a test 944 or 945 in CTE from 226 it has to use the same versions of the 944 and 945 maps as I have in production for DC 240.

Thanks for your continued support.

Please note I put the responses in the email you sent to me as well.

Responses are as follows:

1) ?I wrote the new map based off the current XML for the 867. The tag, bracketed in red in the image below, <tradingPartnerInterchangeNumber> precedes the value we want for the Trading Partner and succeeded by </tradingPartnerInterchangeNumber>.

The 15 character limit indicates the maximum amount of characters allowed to be sent from the customer per their specs. The actual number sent may be less. Preceding zeros are not required, but may be added if not having them causes an inconsistency.

2) Please update to MM.DD.YYYY

3)This relates to my comments on point 1, the XML tags are what I used to identify values beginning and ending.

4)1 & 2 are correct. The ?To Be? column, column D, are new names that should be used.

Right now we are using IBM java1.7.1_64 in our prod and non prod env. Recently we got to know that IBM will not provide support for java 7 from Sep 2019. Therefore if we upgrade WAS to 8.5.5.14, Java SE 8 would be the default Java. Any existing profile that uses Java SDK 6 will be replaced by Java SDK 8. 

If we use WAS 8.5.5.14 then we can use default java 8. So my question is, will IBM provide support for default java 8 If we use WAS 8.5.5.14 ? we want to check whether websphere license would cover java licensing and support, including addressing any java specific vulnerabilities for websphere ?

Unfortunately there is a map issue we need corrected.

So, the actual issue is instead of using the cache manager the SPE is using the database query. So, the fix is to make the SPE use Cache Manager, please correct me if am wrong.

TS001790642,Random House,Customer,"Hello Mike,

This happened in our production system, once we captured all the logs and informations required I have updated the STX control number and processed. That is the reason we have STX control number in the envelope which I provided, but the initial issue is that STX control number has become NULL or empty. 

When multiple process was calling SPE Envelope service for TRADACOMS envelops, I could see two different files having the same control number. After that all the files got failed due to control number was NULL or Empty in STX segment.

This is happening in STX Segment not in MHD MTR segment, the TRADACOMS_ENVELOPE is nothing but a auto-link map, we do not perform anything there, and the map does not update the control number so I think we have nothing to do with the map.

Yes I have configured the port https in the server.xml 9080, we have problems with firewall rules, we have one for this port and I think that this configuration is useful to use the 9080 as a port with TLS protocol.

I'll send you the files requested, The security.proprties (and the security.properties.in) is the original one, I've only change the value of NIST mode property in sandbox as indicated in the link that you share with me:

Solution:
- Set the following values in the security.properties.in file in Sterling B2B Integrator:
- Set NIST mode = transition- Set the TLS protocol range to a value from TLS 1 .0 to TLS 1.2.

Thanks a lot for your collaboration.

The problem is still present.
In this moment the situation is the same of that we leave on Wednesday: I've installed the WTX but I can't reach the interface in this environment, on another hand, I know that the engine are working because we have launch a WTX map and it works.
I want to put the focus of the issue on two point:
1) reach the interface in Stand alone environment with TLS 1.2
2) reach the interface in Cluster environment

TS000794934,"Saint-Gobain Abrasives, Inc.",Customer,"Thanks for the clarification on the global control numbers.  It makes sense, but my fear is if we made this change what it would do in the event that other TPs check for duplicate control numbers and run into an issue suddenly with more than one TP.  I can think of one TP that has questioned ISA control numbers before starting at 00001 (810s for new ID on my side, long story) so I don't know how many do this.

Let's go with option 2 - 855's start with 1, 856's start with 2, and 810's start with 3.  Given their 400 days rule, there is no way we'd send over 100,000 of any of these documents in that 400 day time frame. Is this the point that I also ask for it to be set to start over at 1 after 100,000 have been sent?

TS000794934,"Saint-Gobain Abrasives, Inc.",Customer,"<p>Hi Glenna,</p><p></p><p>The TP is telling me now that there is a requirement that the ISA control numbers be unique for all documents.  For example, if we send an 855 with ISA control number '00005' and an 856 with the same '00005' it shows up as a duplicate in their system.  So I need a way to get around this.  A couple of questions/options:</p><p></p><p>1) Can IBM handle this as a rule per TP, so that each outbound document increments the ISA control number thus being unique?</p><p></p><p>or</p><p></p><p>2) Should we set a rule that each document type starts with a different number, something like the below:</p><p>855 starts with 1.  i.e. ""100005""</p><p>856 starts with 2. i.e. ""200005""</p><p>810 starts with 3.  i.e. ""300005""</p><p></p><p>They said that their check for control numbers being unique stops at around 400 days of history, so this would be plenty of documents before the 400 days is up.</p><p></p><p>Any thoughts on if either of these work?</p><p></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Chase</p>",-0.6669222405609423,,

the UPS DB2 support group said it looks normal on their end. No issue.

We have 2 Linux servers with ITX/ITXA software using the same ITXA DB2 database. The  APPL4 server has few launchers where enveloping is involved as well. This is for railroad's EDI data (404s outbound). I checked log files and I was ably to find a process which was active at 04:30:48 AM. I did not see an issue. Als we did not have to restart launchers running on the APPL4 server. But we had to restart QVD launchers running on the APPL5 server.

I think if there was a DB2 database problem or a network glitch we will see that in the APPL4 environment as well but we do not.

Can you please inform when the filename convention is complete. The messages in CTE are experiencing failures and I'm unable to see what the current naming convention is.   Please ensure that UP Rail's 410 map is set to use ST01, GS03, and ST02 to make filename unique when multiple(ST-SE) coming in one GS-GE. 

Our user's would like to validate the filename convention before the data flow is turned on in Production.

Also, in the REF*VX segment that corresponds to the N1*BY segment, please change REF*VX to ""CT098033429"". The third character should be a ""0"" (zero) and not an ""O"".

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Thank you,

Sherry

Farrow will send files to IBM with File name pattern 
CAentrynumberddmmyyyy.pdf as that is Levi's preferred file name. 

Example: CA7590350002455520181219.pdf 

Could you please make the change so IBM accepts these files from Farrow?

TS002016509,PayPal Inc,Customer,"Hi Kathryn

Is it possible to get on a call to discuss the change in detail and requirements from PayPal.

We will still be using dropzone to exchange the files, but from connectivity side everything will need to be setup again. Nothing is changing in the data/content being provided.

We will be setting up a new dropzone, new PGP key (all steps needed for this new connectivity).

As first step we will establish connectivity in test environment and then will work with IBM to validate the test results.

Once everything looks great we will do the switch to production.

I work in PST time zone and at this point Monday afternoon looks open for call . Please send a invite so we can establish the process going forward.

Thanks
Jitender

Perhaps, I'm missing something here.  I'm running the compliance in ITXA (SPE 9.0.0.8).  I'm not concern with the ITX compliance.  When running the compliance in ITXA, I need it to report the error that you're seeing in ITX compliance.  In this case, ITXA is not reporting the compliance error.  Am I missing something in the envelopes or how can I set it so ITXA will report the error that you're seeing in ITX compliance?

What I notice is if I change the number of segment count from :
SE*136*0021~
to be:
SE*135*0021~

then the compliance does pick up the error.
IK5*R*4~
AK9*R*1*1*0~

However, when the segment count is correct.
SE*136*0021~
then the compliance is reporting as no error.
IK5*A~
AK9*A*1*1*1~

This to me is a bug since the file contains two entries for BHT segments and compliance should report this as an error with a rejection.

We sent a DESADV in response to the DELFOR and Visteon wants the UNG03 updated on it too. Please see Process ID 15579645 in CTE.

The value in UNG03 needs to be 51060 instead of 520A.

I was using a Java code to create a message on a mailbox. This process is good and it works as intended.

For Getting the messages, I first tried on the API UI (https://vlac359:10075/B2BAPIs/svc/mailboxmessages/?_range=0-999&name=) by logging as the user bisbpost-bis which is linked to the mailbox BIS-TRP-BPOST-BIS (only this) with the virtual root /BIS-TRP-BPOST-BIS

As the virtual root is /BIS-TRP-BPOST-BIS, the results should be only the messages under /BIS-TRP-BPOST-BIS. But it lists all the messages from all the mailboxes  available on SBI. 

Do let me know if this is not clear enough so that we could connect over webex so that I can walk you through what I am doing.

Thanks,

TS002177925,Helvetia-Patria Versicherungen,Customer,"Hi Guido,

Yes the idea is that for each http client system a certificate will be generated and that this will be used for authentication and authorization. In order to perform the authorization part we need to be able in the BP to define a user context out of the client-certificate received. This way we can control to which mailboxes the user has access to.

But it seems that when User Authentication (which means HTTP Basic authentication) is not activated, the BP is executed w/o any user context (or maybe with admin user context which would be extremely unsecure...).

Please check the doc attached.

Regards,

Thibaut

2- Install the newer version in a different directory. Kindly confirm the correct recommended approach?
For this question it's up to you.  It's a personal preference and either will work fine.

TS002192295,Andreas Stihl AG & Co.KG,Customer,"Hi Guido,

For the HTTP Client Adapter and Services it says only Logging Level On or Off and it was already On.

I uploaded the customer_overrides.properties and security.properties.

The FedEx support mention the following ciphers yesterday but only the two mentioned before show up in the online SSL report.

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA38ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCMHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA4:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256

TS002192295,Andreas Stihl AG & Co.KG,Customer,"Hi Guido,

The common3splogger.log doesn't say anything about that and the PSLogger only says:

[2019-04-29 11:00:29,632] ERROR Connection data[/194.6.249.119:59792=>/212.8.161.211:443] closed due to CloseCode.HANDSHAKE_FAILURE

For the HTTP Client log I didn't find a DEBUG mode.

But before I gather more logs.
My colleague found out via https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html that only the following cipher suites are supported by FedEx:

TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256

Does the ISBI support these CipherSuites?
Or what would we have to do that the ISBI supports them as well?

Many thanks!

A colleague of mine found out that they might use the CipherSuite ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, so I added it to the list in the customer_overrides.properties:

security.StrongCipherSuite=TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_MD5,TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256,ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256

But it still doesn't work.

TS000903130,Amerisource Bergen,Customer,"Hi Tim,

As discussed last week on call. I created the bp for SPECheckAckStatus and that cleaned all the pending acks from SBX env by itself and I did not needed to run the delete script. Now when I check SPE in sbx, I only see ACKs which are in WAITING state. 
I will go ahead and test this solution in DEV env now and give you the update. In the mean time, can you please check and let me know if by any way we can delete the WAITING state acks as well?

Thanks & Regards,
