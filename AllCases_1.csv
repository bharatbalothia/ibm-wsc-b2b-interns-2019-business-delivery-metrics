Error Details:
The map is configured to expect that the input XML will always contain a ""QN"" Reference at the ShipmentDetails level.  Since there is not ""QN"" Reference at the ShipmentDetails level, the L11 is generated without an L11.01 while the L11.02 is generated.
 
To resolve the input XML needs to be updated so that a ""QN"" Reference exists at the ShipmentDetails level. Otherwise, the map will need to be updated.

Apologize for the confusion. As per the spec, change map to PAC0301 as per example and remove existing data ""SE"" in PAC0301. Need to make change in ""Type of packages"".
?
Example : PAC+1++267::92' ( PAC+ NUMBER OF PACKAGES ++ TYPE OF PACKAGES::92)

Ecolab has asked us to correct the operation id ?:

They only accept below operation ID for EDI 850 from ?Anheuser Busch? as:

 

00304/003040/850 

00300/003040/850 

 But AB is sending as 00301 like below:

ISA*00*         *00*         *14*098630254SOP  *12*6122932712    *190205*0957*U*00301*000000061*0*P*^~

Can you please let me know if possible to correct the operation id from iBM side.
